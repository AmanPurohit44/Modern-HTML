Importance of Accessible Websites:

1. Inclusivity: Accessible websites ensure that everyone, including people with disabilities, can access and use online information and services.

2. Legal Compliance: Many countries have laws requiring websites to be accessible, avoiding legal issues and promoting equal access.

3. User Experience: Accessible design often leads to improved user experiences for everyone, including clear navigation and content structure.

4. Business Growth: Accessible websites reach a wider audience, increasing engagement, loyalty, and potential customer base.
